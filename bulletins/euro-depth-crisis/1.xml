    <title>Germany lays the foundations for a new debt crisis in Europe</title>
    <abstract>
      It’s astonishing to see Germany take active steps to wreck the Eurozone.
      So, now we see which are this proposals from germany e euro survival.
    </abstract>
    <chapter>
      <paragraph> In recent weeks, Germany has put forward two proposals for the ‘future viability’ of the
        EMU that, if approved, would radically alter the nature of the currency union. For the worse.
      </paragraph>
    </chapter>
    <chapter>
      <title>Proposal 1 - promoters</title>
      <paragraph>
        Schäuble, members of the CDU party and governors of the German and French central banks,
        Jens Weidmann and François Villeroy de Galhau.

      <title>Proposal 1 - actions</title>
      <paragraph>
        <list type="ordered">
          <item>Creation of a “eurozone finance ministry”;</item>
          <item>Creation of an “independent fiscal council”.</item>
        </list>
      </paragraph>
    </chapter>
    <chapter>
      <title>Proposal 2 - promoters</title>
      <paragraph>
        German Council of Economic Experts (GCEE), with backing of the Bundesbank,
        the German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble and Draghi.

    <chapter>
      <title>Proposal 2 - actions</title>
      <paragraph>
        <list type="ordered">
          <item>Government bond value would be “weighted” according to the “sovereign default risk”
          (rating, as for example BBB+) of the country in question;</item>
          <item>Putting a “cap” on overall weighted risk owned by a bank;</item>
          <item>Introducing an automatic “sovereign insolvency mechanism”. If a country needs financial
          assistance from ESM, it will have to lengthen sovereign bond maturities and impose an
          “haircut” to private creditors.</item>

    <chapter>
      <title>Problems</title>
      <paragraph>
        <list type="ordered">
          <item>Huge holes in the balance sheets of the banks of the “riskier” countries,
          since they tend to hold a large % of their country’s public debt.</item>
          <item>High probability of massive capital flight from riskier countries to safer countries;</item>
          <item>Almost certainly ignition of a new European bond crisis, as banks rush to offload their holdings
          of “risky” government debt, such as Italy, in favour of “safer” bonds, such as German ones.</item>

      <title>Conseguences</title>
      <paragraph>
        <list type="ordered">
          <item>Risk of a new crisis, because debt value of riskier countries becomes high, and at the same time value
            of their bond goes down; so contries remains without money and this forcing them to turn to the ESM for help,
            which would entail even heavier losses for their banks and an even heavier dose of austerity;</item>
          <item>Governments once again subject to the “discipline” of the markets, as if the 2011-12 sovereign
            debt crisis hadn’t made clear that financial markets are just as incapable of efficiently assessing
            and managing the public finances of countries.</item>

    <title>What if UK leaves EU?</title>
    <chapter>
      <paragraph>

        situation where everyone loses, because of the tight link between UK and EU markets.
        Economists are now trying to focus on the possible or probable consequences both
        positive or negative in terms of number and GDP.
