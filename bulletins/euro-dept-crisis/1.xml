    <chapter>
      <paragraph>In recent weeks, Germany has put forward two proposals for the ‘future viability’ of the
        EMU that, if approved, would radically alter the nature of the currency union. For the worse.

        Schäuble, members of the CDU party and governors of the German and French central banks,
        Jens Weidmann and François Villeroy de Galhau.

          <item>Risk of a new crisis, because debt value of riskier countries becomes high, and at the same time value
            of their bond goes down; so contries remains without money and this forcing them to turn to the ESM for help,
            which would entail even heavier losses for their banks and an even heavier dose of austerity;</item>
          <item>Governments once again subject to the “discipline” of the markets, as if the 2011-12 sovereign
            debt crisis hadn’t made clear that financial markets are just as incapable of efficiently assessing
            and managing the public finances of countries.</item>

    <title>What if UK leaves EU?</title>
    <chapter>
      <paragraph>
        The impact of the UK leaving the European Union creates an instable economic
        situation where everyone loses, because of the tight link between UK and EU markets.
        Economists are now trying to focus on the possible or probable consequences both
        positive or negative in terms of number and GDP.
