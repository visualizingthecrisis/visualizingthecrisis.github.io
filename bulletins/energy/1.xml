     <paragraph>Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil producer, loses an estimated 300,000 barrels a day to criminal gangs that tap crude from pipelines that criss-cross the oil-rich southern delta, using it in local refineries or selling it to tankers waiting offshore, according to state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.</paragraph>
     <paragraph>The country pumped 1.9 million barrels a day last year on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</paragraph>

     <title>Mexico oil giant posts record $32B loss</title>
     <paragraph>Petroleos Mexicanos also known as Pemex, announced not only its 13th consecutive quarterly loss amounting to $9.3 billion, 44% bigger than the previous year, as revenue tumbled by 28% to $15.8 billion, but also a gargantuan $32 billion annual loss and at the same time announced it would slash capex spending to preserve cash and optionality for a future which suddenly looks very bleak.</paragraph>
     <paragraph>The report follows an announcement by the state of Mexico to cut back on its lifeline to the troubled oil giant when on February 17 it said it plans to cut 100 billion pesos ($5.5 billion) from the oil giant’s budget in a move aimed at stemming the depreciation of the peso and limiting inflation in Latin America’s second-largest economy amid the slump in international crude prices.</paragraph>

      <paragraph>In 2015 12,800 MW of new wind power capacity was installed in the EU, an increase of 6.3% over 2014, and more than any other form of power generation, according to recent new figures from the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA).</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Wind power accounted for over 44% of total power capacity installations in the EU last year.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>€26.4 billion was invested in Europe in 2015 to finance wind energy development.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>This was 40% more than the total investment in 2014. The total wind power capacity installed at the end of 2015 could produce 315 TWh and cover 11.4% of the EU electricity consumption in a normal wind year.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Germany for the first time got more electricity from renewables than any other source of energy.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Clean-energy sources met 27.7 percent of Germany’s demand in the nine months through September, for the first time exceeding the 26.3 percent share held by lignite coal, according to calculations by Agora, an influential researcher owned by the Mercator Foundation and European Climate Foundation.</paragraph>
