          <title>The Vatican's sacred gold</title>
          <paragraph>
            When the devaluation of the Italian lira began in late 1994, the Vatican
            withdrew his money and reinvested them in US dollars, Japanese yen , British
            pounds and German marks. The Vatican stepped fully into the European
            Economic Monetary System, which was and still is very useful for net capital
            gains of the Holy See.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>
              Reading the statements never published APSA (the body which manages the
              assets of the Apostolic See ) and some confidential notes signed by the new
              president of the IOR Jean Baptist de Franssu, we understand that important part
              of the treasure is hidden right APSA, which unlike the IOR he has never
              announced his accounts. IOR is a real bank without branches, but which administers
              the capital of the religious orders, the institutions of the Church, the dioceses,
              parishes and other Vatican organizations.</paragraph>

              <paragraph>
                Gold is the most ductile metals in nature, second only to
                platinum, as well as being an excellent conductor of
                electricity, is widely used in the industries of this sector.
                In fact, with only one gram of yellow metal you can draw
                a wire along more than 3 km, as well as for its inertia and
                resistance is also used in the construction of spacecraft
                and robotics. Pure state gold is incorruptible and will not
                rust, which means that it does not deteriorate when
                attacked by atmospheric agents such as air or water, and
                does not change even when it comes in contact with almost all chemicals.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                  For all these reasons, gold is also called the eternal metal. For some years now, thanks to
                  the economic crisis, many thought that it was useful to monetize through gold mining contained in different
                  types of electronic equipment broken or disused.</paragraph>

                <title>What appens to Apple?</title>
                <chapter>
                  <paragraph>
                    Apple has released interesting numbers to understand
                    the volume and the number of materials recycled from old
                    devices of Apple, properly recovered. In the " spoils"
                    there are about 28 thousand tons of steel, aluminum and
                    glass. And more than one ton of gold. Worth over 40 million dollars, in addition to the more
                    than 10 million of the other materials . According communicates Apple, are about 90 million pounds of
                    electronic waste collected through the recycling program,
                    71% of the total weight of the products sold by Apple from 7 years to today.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>
                      But this isn’t the real news! More likely, it was reported that Apple has recycled “40
                      million pounds of electronic waste through its recycling
                      program” and much of this waste come from the iPhone and other Apple old products. Of this waste,1 ton of
                      them was gold, which, according to current prices, worth
                      40 million dollars. Apple has paid independent recyclers to recycle old electronics - and that almost never
                      corresponded to Apple products , however - because the law requires you to do so.</paragraph>
